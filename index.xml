      <description>I am a PhD student in physics, a passionated programmer, a vehement open-source user, a picky musician, and an aspiring artist.
In this blog I want to share my experiences, present the solutions I found to encountered problems, and maybe help some other people out there facing similar challenges.</description>

      <title>What spectra do tell us</title>

      <description>One of the most important tools in digital signal processing, if not THE most important one, is the spectral analysis. In this post I discuss what it might unveil about the recording procedure. Should I just use the line-out of my amp? Or better a microphone picking up the signal of the amp? Well, which microphone then? An old friend always told me a good sound has to travel through air at least once.</description>

      <description>A very important part of digital signal processing (DSP) as well as music processing is to analyze the spectrum and the spectrogram of your recording. Even Audacity already can handle it. So let&amp;rsquo;s use it with Non Timeline or a general JACK-based environment too.
In this blog post I will review the available software for creating spectra in Linux systems and how to deploy them. I will not write about the Fourier transform and spectra in general.</description>

      <title>Using ZynAddSubFx as sound synthesizer in TuxGuitar</title>

      <description>Although not as good as the original GuitarPro, I really like TuxGuitar. After all, it is the only usable software to produce guitar tabs and scores in Linux systems I&amp;rsquo;m aware of. But of all its shortcomings the issues I had with its sound system were the worst: The sound generation is broken quite frequently and the whole program remains silent. In this short post I&amp;rsquo;ll explain to you how to replace the internal sound generator of TuxGuitar with ZynAddSubFX for a more stable and reliable setup.</description>

      <description>After we got an overview about the peculiarities of the Linux system with respect to audio and recording in the last post we will dive some more into the Linux sound system itself.
As for most other Linux subsystems the audio one grew quite naturally too. So you have quite a number of alternatives and different ways to achieve a goal. Not just in using different software, but also in the underlying sound servers.</description>

      <description>As much as I love the Linux system, its incredible amount of free and open-source software and distributions, and the whole supportive community providing awesome documentation etc., the much pain it was to migrate all my music recording and mixing from Windows to Linux. It cost me numerous sleepless nights and resulted in some quite discouraging failures during my first year of diving into open-source.
The reason I had a hard time back then was not a lack of good documentation or badly implemented software.</description>
