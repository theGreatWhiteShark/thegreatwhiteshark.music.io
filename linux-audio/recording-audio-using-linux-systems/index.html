<p>As much as I love the Linux system, its incredible amount of free and
open-source software and distributions, and the whole supportive
community providing awesome documentation etc., the much pain it was
to migrate all my music recording and mixing from Windows to Linux. It
cost me numerous sleepless nights and
resulted in some quite discouraging failures during my first year of
diving into open-source.</p>

<p>The reason I had a hard time back then was not a lack of good
documentation or badly implemented software. No, quite the
opposite. It was the vast amount of different choices I select. Which
program to use for recording, which underlying sound server, should I
use a real-time kernel or not&hellip; And with every choice I made several
new options popped up. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, this is the true power of
the Linux system and enables advanced users to surpass everything they
possible could accomplish with Windows or Mac. But back then I was
(even more of) a newbie and I simply failed to get the bigger picture
of the Linux sound system. As a result, I was not able to trace back
occurring errors and thus could not properly
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">search</a> for a solution online.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I want to share my experience and try to give you the
bigger picture of the Linux sound system and its interplay with the
recording software. I will not provide you with
detailed information about how to use specific software. This you can
find in many places online, foremost at the official web
page of the software. This post concentrates more on the peculiarities
of Linux&rsquo; take
on audio and the differences to other operating systems. In addition I
will point out some nice applications to start recording with and hook
you up with a number of links for further reading so you can pick your
own flavor of the Linux audio experience.</p>

<h1 id="for-whom-i-write-these-lines">For whom I write these lines?</h1>

<p>I intend to write this post for both musicians thinking about using
free and open-source tools to handle their music and for Linux users
curious about recording some audio.</p>

<p>I will divide this topic in two separate posts: In the this <strong>first
post</strong> I will provide a simple introduction into the Linux sound
system, but concentrate more on its overall character and on programs
to use during recording. So if you just want to record some music and
are not that
interested into the underlying peculiarities of the Linux sound
system, here you will find what you are looking for.</p>

<p>If you experience some problems with you setup or want to learn more
about what&rsquo;s going on under the hood, check out the <a href="/linux-sound-server">second
post</a> of this topic. In there I will shed some
light on how the
<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Main_Page">ALSA</a> part of
the Linux kernel is handling your sound cards and how the interplay
and the configuration of the Linux sound servers
<a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a> and
<a href="http://jackaudio.org/">JACK</a> does work.</p>

<p>Please note that these posts are tailored for actual audio
recording. But if you want to generate some electronic sounds using
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI">MIDI</a> instead, don&rsquo;t worry. Most
of the steps described in here will apply as well.</p>

<h1 id="what-makes-linux-audio-processing-hard-different">What makes Linux audio processing hard/different?</h1>

<p>For those of you new to the Linux system you might wonder why I make
such a big deal out of this topic. Can&rsquo;t we just use a big program
handling everything related to our recording session, a so called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_audio_workstation">Digital Audio Workstation
(DAW)</a>, like
Cubase on Windows or Pro Tools on Mac?</p>

<p>Unfortunately not. Linux is just not intended to be used this way and
it is very important for you to understand the actual difference to be
able to harness its true power.</p>

<h2 id="the-unix-principle">The Unix principle</h2>

<p>One of the core concepts of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix
philosophy</a> is to</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Write programs, which do one thing and do it well</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This way you break down complex problems into smaller ones, each
addressed by one free and open-source program (and its alternatives)
and maintained by a small group of people. Those small and robust
programs you can then glue together to produce a sophisticated,
modular, and highly personalized workflow solving all your problems.</p>

<p>What sounds really nice for programming tasks or the personalization
of your desktop feels quite alarming when handling audio. So there is
a program handling the playback of your recorded audio, another one
applying a compressor to it, and a third one being the compressor
itself? And I have to glue them together manually? Well, yes and no,
not necessarily.</p>

<p>Fortunately the handling of the effect chain is done by your recording
software, relying on the underlying Linux sound server responsible for
gluing the individual programs together. So by using <a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/">Non
DAW</a> or <a href="https://ardour.org/">Ardour</a> with
JACK or <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> with PulseAudio you
will have a DAW for handling your audio after all.</p>

<p>Well, then what does make the Linux system different? Two things:
First, you
are not restricted to your DAW anymore. You want to extract some audio
from a movie and incorporate it into your music? Just connect the
<a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/">vlc player</a> or another sound source in
your system to your recording program. You found a neat little
(jack-aware, see later)
audio tool in the internet? Just integrate it into your workflow. The
difference in volume between dialogs and action scenes in movies gets
on your nerves? Just add a compressor between your browser/media
player and your system&rsquo;s sound output. The possibilities are endless.</p>

<p>Secondly, if some plugin (like an EQ) in your recording software
crashes, do not blame the authors of your DAW. Most of the times those
little plugins (like <a href="http://lv2plug.in/">LV2</a>,
<a href="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</a>, <a href="http://calf-studio-gear.org/">Calf</a>
, or <a href="http://tap-plugins.sourceforge.net/">TAP</a>) are small programs
themselves being maintained by a different group of people. Keep this
in mind while searching for a solution online!</p>

<h2 id="multi-user-system">Multi-user system</h2>

<p>The Linux system is intended to be used by many users at the same
time. Not just the huge machines in some clusters of universities or
companies, but your personal laptop with just one configured user
account too. Just enter the following command into your
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29">Bash</a> to list
all available users on your system.</p>

<pre><code class="language-bash">cat /etc/passwd
</code></pre>

<p>Next to your actual user and root there are many system services, like
<em>lp</em> for printing or <em>lightdm</em> for handling your graphical desktop,
having an user account by themselves. This is done by Linux in order
to strength the security of your system. Even when an intruder is able
to obtain access to one of your system&rsquo;s services, the person would
end up in an account having very limited privileges. For all those
different users to work together on a single machine, the Linux kernel
provides a scheduling system that allows all users to access the
system&rsquo;s resources, the CPU, and all the additional hardware on more
or less equal terms.</p>

<p>But here we run into problems when dealing with audio on a Linux
system: accessing your sound card and writing the input to disk
by your DAW does have in principle the same priority as your
Thunderbird while checking your mail. The more users/programs/services
want to use your CPU, the less time every one has to perform its
task. Thus the latency (the time your signal needs traveling from the
input of your sound card to the speakers) in Linux systems is quite
high.</p>

<p>In order to reduce the latency one can use a Linux kernel tailored for
real-time usage (those with an <em>-rt-</em> in their name) or allow the
recording software to put a higher load on the CPU by changing the
configuration of the underlying Linux sound server. Both options are
not at all
recommended for people new to the Linux system. You haven&rsquo;t compiled
your own Linux kernel yet? Then do not consider doing so just to
improve your latency!</p>

<p>Four years ago I wanted to get Ardour and JACK running on low
latency. But on heavy load the setup created some kernel panic (as I
know in hindsight) and my system froze whenever I something was going
on in the background or my Ardour-files were getting to large. I tried
to fix it. But I failed and it was a massive waste of time. Better
don&rsquo;t go along this direction.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong. I encourage you to try some low latency
settings. But when you experience severe problems you can not really
reproduce, do it as Scar advised in the lion king: run away and never
return! (unless you become a Linux-pro by then)</p>

<p>So when you do not need a very low latency setting, don&rsquo;t go for it!</p>

<h1 id="choice-of-recording-software-and-sound-server">Choice of recording software and sound server</h1>

<p>Now that you are aware of the most important features and restrictions
of the Linux sound system, let&rsquo;s try to answer the following question:
<em>What recording software and Linux sound server fits me best?</em></p>

<h2 id="need-for-low-latency">Need for low latency</h2>

<p>The most pressing subquestion on our way the determine the answer of
the former one is: <em>Do I need a low latency setup?</em></p>

<p>You do so whenever you want to use monitoring (listen to the recorded
sound) while recording. This is for example the case when you input a
clean guitar into your system, apply an amp simulation via some
software, and listen to the resulting output while actually playing
the guitar. Another common scenario is to play a keyboard while using
not the keyboard&rsquo;s sound synthesizer but a Linux based one.</p>

<p>In those cases you should use the JACK sound server over
PulseAudio since the former has a better latency handling. Along
with it I would recommend using the Non DAW (or Ardour) as recording
software. Use the
default settings of the sound server and check whether the
latency is already low enough for you to barely hear any delay at
all. If you do and you have to get to even lower latencies, you have
no other choice but to apply some <a href="https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/system_configuration">real-time
settings</a> for
your kernel and settings.</p>

<p>If you have a nice amp and want to record, mix, and master your music,
you are actually not in need of a low latency setting. Instead I would
highly recommend you to buy an external sound card capable of
monitoring on its own. Those devices split the signal into two and
supply both your computer and some headphones/boxes with the original
sound. Therefore, there is no need anymore to keep the latency
as low as possible. I&rsquo;m using
<a href="http://tascam.com/product/us-2x2/">this</a> sound card and it&rsquo;s doing
quite a fine job. But before you get yourself a sound card, make sure
it will run properly with your Linux system (list of supported devices
by the
<a href="http://www.alsa-project.org/main/index.php/Matrix:Main">alsa-project</a>
and the (German) audio for Linux
<a href="http://wiki.datentraeger.org/index.php?title=Hardware">page</a>).</p>

<h2 id="degree-of-sophistication-of-your-sound-server">Degree of sophistication of your sound server</h2>

<p>In case you don&rsquo;t need a very low latency setting, you have two
choices:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the
<a href="https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/PulseAudio">PulseAudio</a>
system along with <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a>, which
works out of the box and is a very robust but basic system. For
some quick recording and mixing this should be your
system of choice. If you on the other hand do not intend to just
record and mix some tracks but to build your own professional audio
processing system, you will find its features too limiting.</li>
<li>Use the <a href="http://jackaudio.org/">JACK</a> sound server with <a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/">Non
DAW</a> or
<a href="https://ardour.org/">Ardour</a>. This setup let&rsquo;s you harness all the
power of the Linux sound system but it&rsquo;s also not that straight
forward to set up and configure.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you are (completely) new to Linux or want to get things done
quickly, I would
recommend you to use the first option. In all other cases try the
second one. It needs more time to get started, but you will have more
powerful tools at hand in the long run.</p>

<p>In the next sections I will present a number of helpful programs to
be used along with those two options. This will be of course just a
very sparse compilation and most of the programs will actually run
with both sound servers. It&rsquo;s intended to serve as a convenient starting
point for the corresponding setup. For a more detailed introduction
into the individual applications, please follow the corresponding
links, and for more information regarding the sound server and their
configuration, please see the second post related to this topic.</p>

<h1 id="recording-using-pulseaudio">Recording using PulseAudio</h1>

<p>The best thing of the PulseAudio setup is: it&rsquo;s (most probably)
already installed and running on your Linux system. So you basically
just have to install the other programs via your packet manager and
you are good to go.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-pulseaudio">Configuring PulseAudio</h2>

<p>The different inputs and outputs of your sound system can best be
handled using <strong>pavucontrol</strong>. But be careful! You can use this
control to test your system. But do not try to select one and the same
sound card (in case you have more than one) with both Pavucontrol and
Audacity. They will interfere with each other and you most probably
end up with no input/output signal in Audacity.</p>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/pavucontrol.png" alt="image pavucontrol" /></p>

<p>Also check out <strong>pasystray</strong> to control PulseAudio via a small icon in
your status bar and <strong>paprefs</strong> if you want to use it via your local
network.</p>

<p>Local network? That&rsquo;s right, you can use PulseAudio to transmit audio
signals via your
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PulseAudio/Examples#PulseAudio_over_network">network</a>. So
in principle you just have to have one computer (e.g. a Raspberry)
connected to your speakers and all your other devices can stream
their audio to this machine for playback. I works rather smoothly but
it&rsquo;s not intended to be used with wireless connections.</p>

<h2 id="audacity">Audacity</h2>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/audacity-linux.png" alt="image audacity" /></p>

<p><a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/">Audacity</a> is a full-fledged recording
software allowing you record audio and mix the results. It features a
<a href="http://wiki.audacityteam.org/wiki/Audacity_Wiki_Home_Page">wiki</a>, a
detailed <a href="http://manual.audacityteam.org/">manual</a>, and an active
<a href="http://forum.audacityteam.org/">community</a>. Check out its <a href="http://www.audacityteam.org/about/features/">feature
list</a> to get a feeling of
what it&rsquo;s capable of.</p>

<p>I do like this program a lot. It&rsquo;s simple, got many essential features
without being overloaded, and it&rsquo;s easy to use. As long as you do just
basic recording and a little bit of audio manipulation, you will find
everything there you need.</p>

<p>For a more profound audio processing I would nevertheless discourage
you from using it. The reason is its invasive audio
manipulation. In other words, every time you apply an effect to some
selected audio the original one gets overwritten. In order to slightly
change a parameter of your effect, you have
to undo your changes and reapply the effect with a different
setting. This gets quite cumbersome as soon as you want to mix many
audio tracks in parallel.</p>

<p>For all of you who have tried Audacity in the past: Compared to its
state when I first came into contact with it some ten years ago the
application did a huge step forward. So it may be much more powerful
than you actually think. Just give it a shot. ;)</p>

<h2 id="lmms">LMMS</h2>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/lmms.png" alt="image lmms" /></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s Audacity for working with sound signals (e.g. an amplified
guitar) is <a href="https://lmms.io/">LMMS</a> for working with MIDI sounds. It
features an extensive <a href="https://lmms.io/documentation/">documentation</a>
and serves as both a MIDI sequencer (a program to write MIDI tracks)
and a MIDI sound synthesizer (a program replacing a MIDI signal with a
corresponding sound).</p>

<p>LMMS offers a great way to produce some electronic sound. If you on
the other hand just intend to produce some artificial drums (and
nothing more), I would recommend the use of Hydrogen instead (see
later).</p>

<h1 id="recording-using-jack">Recording using JACK</h1>

<p>The configuration of <a href="http://jackaudio.org/">JACK</a> is not as straight
forward as with PulseAudio. Fortunately you do not necessarily have to
get a plain Linux distribution and set up the JACK server all by
yourself. Others already did this for you and bundled the result with
a ton of audio software. Thus, you find a number of different
Linux distributions already tailored for audio recording and
processing. If you are new to Linux, I would definitely recommend
using one of those (maybe on an addition
<a href="http://linuxbsdos.com/2014/11/08/a-beginners-guide-to-disks-and-disk-partitions-in-linux/">partition</a>
using <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Grub2">Grub2</a>).</p>

<p>The most widely used ones are
<a href="https://ubuntustudio.org/">UbuntuStudio</a> and
<a href="http://linuxbsdos.com/2014/11/08/a-beginners-guide-to-disks-and-disk-partitions-in-linux/">KXStudio</a>. They
do not just provide a preconfigured environment but also loads of
resources and documentation to use them properly. Others are
<a href="https://www.ap-linux.com/">Audiophile Linux</a>, <a href="http://www.bandshed.net/avlinux/">AV
Linux</a>, or
<a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Fedora_jam">FedoraJam</a>.</p>

<p>Worth mentioning, but quite out of context, is also
<a href="http://www.runeaudio.com/">RuneAudio</a>. It intends to convert your
mini computer into a high quality media server.</p>

<h2 id="configuring-jack">Configuring JACK</h2>

<p>To handle JACK you firstly have to
<a href="http://libremusicproduction.com/articles/demystifying-jack-%E2%80%93-beginners-guide-getting-started-jack">configure</a>
its startup and secondly to deal with all the connections between the
programs.</p>

<p>For both steps there are a number of programs solving the task. But I
would recommend <a href="https://qjackctl.sourceforge.io/">QJackCtl</a>, which
can handle both of them.</p>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/qjackctlMainForm1.png" alt="image qjackctl" /></p>

<p>To connect the output of one app with the input of another, just press
the <em>Connect</em> button and draw a line between the two nodes by hand.</p>

<p>As an alternative (e.g. when you are using KXStudio) you can use
<a href="http://kxstudio.linuxaudio.org/Applications:Cadence">Cadence</a> and its
siblings to control the JACK sound server.</p>

<p>Note: you have to use
<a href="http://jackaudio.org/applications/">applications</a> capable of
communicating with JACK!</p>

<h2 id="non-daw">Non DAW</h2>

<p>Instead of providing a monolithic DAW defying the Unix principle, the
<a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/">Non DAW</a> consists of four stand-alone
applications.</p>

<h4 id="non-timeline-http-non-tuxfamily-org-wiki-non-20timeline"><a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Timeline">Non Timeline</a></h4>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/non-timeline.png" alt="image non-timeline" /></p>

<p>For recording and editing audio.</p>

<h4 id="non-sequencer-http-non-tuxfamily-org-wiki-non-20sequencer"><a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Sequencer">Non Sequencer</a></h4>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/non-sequencer.png" alt="image non-sequencer" /></p>

<p>For sequencing and synthesizing MIDI sounds.</p>

<h4 id="non-mixer-http-non-tuxfamily-org-wiki-non-20mixer"><a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Mixer">Non Mixer</a></h4>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/non-mixer.png" alt="image non-mixer" /></p>

<p>For mixing different audio tracks (recorded in e.g. Non Timeline or
Non Sequencer) and applying effects like LADSPA to them.</p>

<h4 id="non-session-manager-http-non-tuxfamily-org-wiki-non-20session-20manager"><a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/wiki/Non%20Session%20Manager">Non Session Manager</a></h4>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/non-session.png" alt="image non-session" /></p>

<p>To control and restore your recording session.</p>

<p>You are not forced to use or even install those four applications
together. You could easily use e.g. a different mixer instead of the
Non one (but I would highly recommend to stick with the original one)
with Non Timeline.</p>

<p>Since the Non suite is incredibly powerful and at the same time very
slim and clearly structured as well as really fast, it is my recording
application of choice. The only downside for Linux newbies may be the
fact that you have to compile those applications from source. (Well,
maybe they are part of the repositories of some Linux audio
distributions. Don&rsquo;t know)</p>

<h2 id="ardour">Ardour</h2>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/ardour.png" alt="image ardour" /></p>

<p>An alternative to the Non suite is <a href="https://ardour.org/">Ardour</a>. For
a JACK-based application it is quite user friendly since it takes care
of starting up your JACK server and connecting all the basic inputs
and outputs. On the other hand the application itself is overloaded by
features and has grown more complex than necessary.</p>

<p>But again: If you are new to the Linux system, this might be the
better entry point into the JACK-based world of audio processing.</p>

<h1 id="further-applications-and-hints">Further applications and hints</h1>

<h2 id="hydrogen">Hydrogen</h2>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/hydrogen.png" alt="image hydrogen" /></p>

<p>Whenever you want to make some artificial drums along with your music,
I would recommend the usage of
<a href="http://www.hydrogen-music.org/hcms/">Hydrogen</a>. It serves as an
application for both programming/writing your MIDI-based drum tracks
and replacing the MIDI notes by synthesized drum sounds. Keep this
in mind. It was strange for me in at first, but tools like EZdrummer
actually do the work of two programs seamlessly: of a MIDI sequencer
and a MIDI synthesizer.</p>

<p>Worth mentioning is also <a href="https://www.drumgizmo.org/wiki/">DrumGizmo</a>
due to its very interesting approach. But this program serves as a
synthesizer only and you have to rely on LMMS or Hydrogen to create
your MIDI drum track.</p>

<h2 id="tuxguitar">TuxGuitar</h2>

<p><img src="/thegreatwhiteshark.music.io/images/posts/2017/recording-audio-using-linux-systems/tuxguitar.jpeg" alt="image tuxguitar" /></p>

<p><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/tuxguitar/">TuxGuitar</a> is the
open-source alternative to GuitarPro and an awesome way of noting down
your (string-based) music.</p>

<p>For quite some years the project seemed to be abandoned. But luckily
someone continued the development and there were two new released
versions during the last year (2016). So the tux is not dying here
after all. :)</p>

<h2 id="communities-dedicated-to-linux-audio">Communities dedicated to Linux audio</h2>

<p>Of course there are a number of web pages specialized in providing you
with information about the Linux audio system and how to use its tools
for crafting music.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://linuxmusicians.com/">LinuxMusician</a> and their <a href="https://wiki.linuxaudio.org/wiki/start">wiki</a></li>
<li><a href="http://planet.linuxaudio.org/">planet.linuxaudio.org</a> and their
<a href="http://www.linuxaudio.org">main page</a> to get in touch with new
projects, resources, and software for Linux audio</li>
<li><a href="http://www.crazy-audio.com/">Crazy audio</a></li>
<li><a href="libremusicproduction.com">Libre Music Production</a></li>
<li><a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Professional_audio">ArchLinux
wiki</a> on
how to configure a professional Linux audio system</li>
<li><a href="a4l.de">Audio4Linux</a> a German web page with a nice
<a href="http://wiki.datentraeger.org/index.php?title=Hauptseite">wiki</a> and
<a href="http://www.audio4linux.de/forum">forum</a></li>
<li><a href="http://linux-audio.com/">Linux-audio.com</a> featuring a general
introduction into Linux as well as a number of links to
configuration tutorials</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="about-amp-emulation">About amp emulation</h2>

<p>As with most commercial DAWs within Linux you also have the option of
recording a clean guitar sound and emulating the effect of an
amplifier using software (e.g. with <a href="http://guitarix.org/">Guitarix</a>
or <a href="http://rakarrack.sourceforge.net/">Rakarrack</a>). But at this
point you really start to feel the difference between free and
open-source software and overpriced commercial one. The artificial
guitar (and drum) sounds of Linux applications are not that
sophisticated.</p>

<p>Instead I would recommend you to get a small (preferably valve-based)
amplifier and some effect pedals and record your songs via the line-in
or microphone. I have a <a href="https://www.blackstaramps.com/uk/products/ht-5r">Blackstar
HT-5</a> for all my home
recordings and I enjoy it very much. One to five watt are more than
enough for your living room and nothing can beat a real valve amp.</p>

<h2 id="recording-tips">Recording tips</h2>

<p>I won&rsquo;t go into any detail regarding the actual recording procedure in
here. You can find lots of recording tutorials online.</p>

<p>Do not restrict your search to the applications named above. Almost
all tools in Cubase or Pro Tools do have an equivalent in the Linux
world and with your working setup you can transfer their tips and
tricks to the Linux realm in no time.</p>

<p>Only a few hints to wrap things up:
- Tune your instrument and attach new strings
- Always use a microphone instead of the line-out of your amp (for the
  final recording). A good sound has to travel through air at least
  once
- Do not try to make each single instrument sound as massive as
  possible. In the end it&rsquo;s their interplay between all of them that
  matters most and in mixing you end up cutting as many frequencies as
  you are boosting.</p>

<h1 id="further-audio-posts-i-plan-to-do-in-this-blog">Further audio posts I plan to do in this blog</h1>

<p>In the near future I intend to fulfill one of my longtime dreams: to
go on a journey for the perfect sound of my music.</p>

<p>Being able to compose and play the music you love the most is just one
side of the coin. The other is its actual sound. I want to shape the
sound of my music the best way possible by just using my little guitar
amp and tons of free and open-source software. And of course I also
intend to write about it. :)</p>

<p>Just in case it takes me a while and you are already curious, I will
provide you with my current curriculum for the next
week(end)s/months.</p>

<p>After reading chapter 10 of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Crafting-Digital-Media-Audacity-Blender/dp/1430218878">Daniel James&rsquo; Crafting digital
media</a>
for an introduction (don&rsquo;t buy the whole book for this one chapter), I
will read the following:
1. The first two chapters of <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319219448">Meinard Müller&rsquo;s - Fundamentals of Music
   Processing</a> to get
   the vocabulary of the music processing community
2. The documentation of different Linux audio plugins
   (<a href="http://lv2plug.in/">LV2</a>, <a href="http://www.ladspa.org/">LADSPA</a>,
   <a href="http://calf-studio-gear.org/">Calf</a> , or
   <a href="http://tap-plugins.sourceforge.net/">TAP</a>) and decide which set of
   those I will use along the next parts of the journey
3. Read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Audio-2e-Roey-Izhaki/dp/0240522222">Izhaki - Mixing
   Audio</a>
   to get some basic mixing skills
4. Read rest of <a href="https://www.springer.com/us/book/9783319219448">Meinard Müller - Fundamentals of Music
   Processing</a> to
   learn how to analyze audio. The overall goal is to be able to
   manipulate music in such a way it sounds as close as possible as
   some reference songs
5. Read <a href="http://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/bob-katz-mastering-audio">Bob Katz - Mastering Audio: the art and the
   science</a>
   to get deeper knowledge about the mastering process</p>
