	  <section class="post-content">
	    <p>During the past 10 years of making music, recording both mine and
other people&rsquo;s bands, and talking with countless musicians I picked up
a lot of different facts and hints concerning music production. But
it was basically just a collection of a lot of details, which did
not made me see the bigger picture. So what was the purpose of
mastering again? Is the DAW, which I use for recording my songs,
sufficient for the mixing procedure? What software can I do the
mastering in? And do I actually need it?</p>

<p>To answer these and many other questions and to be finally able to
craft not just the music but also the sound I have in mind, I read
some books about recording, mixing, and mastering.</p>

<p>What I will report is of course just a very superficial summary of
those topics and the techniques are just briefly mentioned without a
detailed explanation. If you want to learn more about all the things
mentioned in this post, I would recommend to read some very nice books
I came across.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Studio-techniques-Television-Recording/dp/0240519116">Sound
studio</a>
by Alec Nisbett is a nice and well written book about the very
basics of recording and music production. What is sound? How it is
produced and how does it travel
through air? It explains the capturing of sound in a lot of detail,
discusses the different kinds of microphones, their benefits and
shortcomings, and how to improve the sound in your living or
rehearsal room with just a few steps. Therefore, it is an excellent
book on the recording of audio. But it does not stop there. It also
explains the basics of dynamics, equalization, and
reverberation. Although it covers some parts of the mixing and
mastering step, I would definitely recommend reading some additional
books entirely focusing on these topics.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mixing-Audio-2e-Roey-Izhaki/dp/0240522222">Mixing audio</a>
by Roey Izhaki and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Mastering-Guide-Modern-Studio/dp/0240523709">Practical
Mastering</a>
by Mark Cousins and Russ Hepworth-Sawyer are both comprehensive
books on mixing and mastering respectively. While they are packed
with detailed information including various parameter settings and
practical examples, they do not miss to provide basic introductions
and to pick up readers, who have not looked into the particular
fields at all.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="recording">Recording</h1>

<p>The overall goal of the recording step is probably the one most
straight forward and easily to comprehend. We want to capture the
sound of one or several instruments in a studio or rehearsal room in a
digital format. Using the recorded audio files, we can assemble the
final product, e.g. an album, soundtrack etc, later on.</p>

<p>The most important point you have to keep in mind is that you should
make an effort to capture exactly the sound you want your instrument
to have later on. There are a lot of tricks one can play during the
mixing and mastering step, but none of them involves magic. Even the
best sound engineers won&rsquo;t make your music sound awesome if your
recording was performed very poorly. You should use the best
microphones you have access to. They should not color the sound and
capture the whole frequency range of the instrument. If you capture
just the bass and mid ones, there is no way of regaining the high end
of the spectrum.</p>

<p>In order to have the least amount of noise and contribution of other
instruments, it is a good idea to record the instruments one after
each other. Typically, one would start with the drums and use its
audio as a playback for the other instruments. This could, however,
cause some loss of energy in music, which is mainly supposed to be
played
live. Here, you should only record the drums and one guitar in the
first steps with a careful arrangement of the microphones to reduce
the intake between the instruments. Vocals should always be recorded
separately.</p>

<p>When a room is used for the recording, which is quite big, you could
have some nasty reverberation in your audio. This is almost never a
good thing to have. In such a case you are better off placing a lot of
objects in your room and on the wall, like curtains, flags, shelves,
or pictures, to break down the reflections and to absorb part of their
energy. You can always add some artificial reverberation (AR) in the
mixing step.</p>

<p>Toy with the placement of the microphones. Sometimes a couple of
centimeters off the axis of the speaker of your guitar amp does the
trick and the angle might be crucial for the perfect sound of your
snare drum. Let the recording run, produce some sounds, adjust the mic
position and report it to the microphone, produce some sounds, and so
on. Afterwards you can pick the best placement corresponding to the
best-sounding take. As I mentioned beforehand, a good recording
quality is key to an awesome sound. Also do mind the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximity_effect_(audio)">proximity
effect</a>, which
gives you too much power in the lower end of the spectrum, by placing
the mic at least 10-15cm away from the source of the sound.</p>

<h3 id="tools">Tools</h3>

<ul>
<li>Microphones</li>
<li>Audio interfaces</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hints">Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Use good microphones and audio interfaces</li>
<li>Record instruments separately (or at least with different microphones)</li>
<li>When recording with multiple microphones, place them in such a way
the overlap of their fields of recorded sound is as small as
possible</li>
<li>Match the frequency responses of the microphones with the
frequencies produced by sound source</li>
<li>Place the microphones at least 10-15cm away from the sound source
(if possible) to prevent the proximity effect</li>
<li>Shape your sound prior to the recording (adjust the sound of your
guitar using the knobs on your amp over doing it via plugins during
the mixing step)</li>
<li>Keep in mind: each instrument might have its own best sound but at
the end of the day it&rsquo;s the sound of the whole ensemble that matters
(When using two guitars adjust their frequencies so they are
complementary. Cut one guitar at high and boost it at mid frequencies
and do it the other way around for the second one. Cut the lower
part of the spectrum to keep enough room for the bass guitar)</li>
<li>Record the instruments one after each other or use a metronome to
align them in time</li>
<li>For guitar and bass amps: let the sound travel through air instead
of using the lineout</li>
<li>Record your guitar tracks twice and place both them both in the mix
for a more powerful guitar sound (if you have just one guitar in
your ensemble try to use two different sound settings)</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mixing">Mixing</h1>

<p>In the mixing step we take all the recorded audio files and combine
them together into one single (stereo) signal. During this process we
want all the individual instruments to keep their characteristic sounds
but also to blend them in such a way they get along with each other
smoothly. Also, the overall character and attitude of the music should
be maintained and possibly intensified.</p>

<p>A core concept we will use to produce a defined and at the same time
powerful sound is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spectral_density#Explanation">spectrum</a>
of our audio files. Since we used good
microphones to record the individual instruments, most of them cover a
broad range of frequencies. But as soon as there is more than one
instrument in a certain frequency band, our ears have problems in
distinguishing between them. This leads to a <em>dull</em> sound. On the
other hand, if our instruments didn&rsquo;t covered the whole frequency
range the human ears are sensible in, the signal will sound <em>weak</em>
and boring. So our goal is to align the different instruments in the
spectrum in such a way each of them gets its own range it has the most
power in and the gaps between those ranges become minimal.</p>

<p>This task is performed by <strong>equalizers</strong>. But it&rsquo;s not the only one. We
will also use equalizers to remove artifacts introduced in the
recording step. There are three main types. <em>Low-pass</em> and <em>high-pass</em>
filters are used to both cope with the proximity effect introduced by
the placement of the microphone and to remove the power from the lower
or higher end of the frequency spectrum so e.g. the bass guitar does
not enter
the range of the bass drum or the guitars do not enter the range of
the bass guitar. <em>Shelving filter</em> boost or cut all frequencies below or
above a certain crossover frequency in a uniform way. They can be used
for example used to place two similar guitar sounds in different
neighbouring frequency ranges. Finally, the are <em>parametric</em> or
<em>graphical</em> equalizers, which give the user a fine tuned control
over the frequencies of a signal. They can be used to enhance the
sound of an instrument, like boosting the higher harmonics of a snare
at around 1kHz, or to make its sound more dominant in the mix by
cutting the same frequency in all other audio signals.</p>

<p>Which frequency to cut or to boost is a central question in the mixing
step. An easy way to choose them is to use a parametric equalizer with
a very small bandwidth and an unreasonable high gain. Then one
gradually
increases or reduces its frequency and carefully listens whether to
the sound changes for the better or the worse. If you found the right
frequency, it&rsquo;s
time to set the gain and bandwidth to their default values and
change them gradually until the perfect setting is found. Another way
to access the spectrum of an audio signal is by just displaying it and
its change due to the effects applied to it. Check my post on
<a href="/spectral-analysis-linux">spectral analysis</a> for a discussion of
different applications for Linux.</p>

<p>The second most important part of the mixing step is to handle the
individual volumes and dynamics of the instruments, which is done by a
tool called <strong>compressor</strong> or its extreme version called limiter. It
reduces the volume of a signal above a certain threshold by a factor,
determined by the <em>ratio</em> of the compressor, while leaving the parts
of the signal with lesser volumes untouched. It can be used to tame
the variability of the loudness of an instrument.</p>

<p>Apart from these two major tools there is a whole zoo of smaller ones,
like <strong>gates</strong> for noise reduction and <strong>reverbs</strong> for adding some
room coloration. But I can&rsquo;t be comprehensive in here, so I have
to point to the references above instead.</p>

<p>An important note to make is about the good old saying <em>the loader,
the better</em>. Well, it is actually true. Our ears perceive the same
music played at a louder level as preferable since it is more
responsive to the high and low frequencies at those volumes. What
seems to be side note is actually one of the biggest pitfalls in the
mixing and mastering steps. When applying an equalizer or compressor,
which is boosting the signal, you have to be very careful to not let
your judgment about the quality of the sound be clouded by the
difference in volume. Instead, you should constantly ride the gain to
compensate for such differences in volume.</p>

<h3 id="tools-1">Tools</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I am using the program XXX. Can I use it for mixing and/or mastering?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Is your program capable of handling multiple tracks of audio? Can it
use plugins providing you equalizers, compressors etc.? This is
basically all it needs.</p>

<p>There is also no need at all to invest (money) into audio software
handling the recording, mixing, and mastering. You are better of
buying decent hardware like microphones, amps, and audio interfaces
instead and use open source software to do the job. In a previous
<a href="/recoding-audio-using-linux-systems">post</a> I gave an overview about
the software available for Linux. Personally I use the <a href="http://non.tuxfamily.org/">Non
suite</a> for recording, mixing, and
mastering. But this is a matter of taste and you are free to choose
whatever DAW you like.</p>

<ul>
<li>Equalizers</li>
<li>Compressors</li>
<li>Gates</li>
<li>Reverbs</li>
<li>(Distortion &amp; Phaser &amp; Flangers etc. pp. to alter the audio)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hints-1">Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Every instrument should occupy its own frequency range, where it has
more power then the other ones</li>
<li>The distance between the different frequency ranges should be
minimal</li>
<li>Use low-pass filters to correct the proximity effect and parametric
eqs to compensate the frequency response of the mic</li>
<li>Use parametric eqs to enhance the characteristics of the instruments</li>
<li>Cut with a small bandwidth and boost with a larger one using
parametric eqs</li>
<li>Use compressors to tame the variations in the loudness of the
instruments</li>
<li>Use a short attack of about 20-30ms in your compressor for the bass
drum and bass guitar and longer attacks for the other instruments</li>
<li>Better cut the silence in the tracks then using gates</li>
<li>If not possible, use gates to suppress noise</li>
<li>Add some additional room coloration using reverbs</li>
<li>Mind the order you apply the effects to your signal. Low-pass &amp;
high-pass -&gt; shelf-filter -&gt; parametric eq -&gt; compressor -&gt; reverb
-&gt; gain</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="mastering">Mastering</h1>

<p>This third and final step is applied on the single (stereo) track
produced at the end of the mixing step. The objective is to shape the
overall sound and dynamic of a song, make different songs of an album
fit together, and to increase the overall loudness of the
track(s). While the first step is an optional one, the latter are
essential for an album to be perceived not just as a collection of
different songs, but as a solid and close piece of art.</p>

<p>The tools we use in this steps have already been introduced in the
mixing step. We will use shelf filters to color the signal and make
different tracks of an album fit together and use compressors to
tighten their dynamic range. But in comparison to the mixing step, we
will only add small details. A boost or cut of 0.7dB might be already
sufficient. Same holds for the compressor. With a very low threshold
and a ratio of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> or a rather high one and a ratio of <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> you can
already alter your dynamics in a very nice way. Overdoing effects in
this stage of the audio production will usually just spoil the result.</p>

<p>A tool, with which you can combine both the coloration and the
reduction of the dynamics, is the so-called multiband compressor. But
it should be used with care. Apart from the &lsquo;the louder, the better&rsquo;
issue discussed in the mixing paragraph you might accidentally alter
the color of your sound while you only wanted to compress the dynamics
of certain frequency ranges. But why would one do so in the first
place? Because the lower end of the frequency spectrum usually holds
the most power. By cutting there one can increase the perceive
loudness.</p>

<p>The <strong>loudness</strong> of your track or album is one of the central
objectives of the mastering stage. Our ears have some inertia when it
comes perceiving the volume of an audio signal. So, having a very
load burst in volume, which only lasts for some milliseconds, in front
of a track will not make our ears to classify the song as a loud
one. Instead, we are more sensitive to the average amplitude of the
signal. Therefore, you can frequently find the abbreviation RMS to
access the loudness of the signal. It represents the mean value of the
root of the squared amplitude of the signal. The mean value is
modelling the inertia of our ears and the root and square ensure the
measure to be non-negative.</p>

<p>But since there is a maximum value of 0dB for the audio signal, the
short burst at the beginning will dominate the overall loudness of the
track. Well, we could just raise the volume after all and let only
this transient exceed the 0dB limit. What would happen? In the
recording
of analogue signals this would lead to distortion. But in our digital
world
it will produce <em>clipping</em>. Everything above this limit will be
chopped of and replaced by a straight line at 0dB. This would,
however, introduce a harsh noise in the signal clearly audible for
everyone. Instead, we will use the so-called <strong>limiter</strong>, an extreme
version of the compressor with its ratio set 1 over infinity (0).</p>

<p>The use of the limiter shouldn&rsquo;t be overdone. There is the
so-called loudness war in which every sound engineer and record
company wants to make their products as loud as possible. And of
course, by overusing the limiter and removing all dynamics from the
signal, we would make it as loud as possible. But the dynamic is an
important part of our song and some clipping effects can not be
avoided in such a process. Instead, I would recommend to don&rsquo;t push
the loudness of your tracks to the limit and mainly use it on
transients.</p>

<p>Apart from the loudness and coloration, the mastering is also the step
where you have to think about an appropriate order of your songs. This
arrangement, as well as fades and silence between the tracks, are
important keys to ensure the flow of your music on an album.</p>

<h3 id="tools-2">Tools</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://jamin.sourceforge.net/">JAMin</a> you can find a very nice
Linux program containing a multiband processor, graphical equalizer,
and limiter. Chaining it to the output of your DAW used for
mixing will make the mastering step in particular convenient.</p>

<h3 id="hints-2">Hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>Slight shelf filters for coloration</li>
<li>Slight compressors for tightening the dynamics</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t overuse effects at this stage</li>
<li>Use coloration to make the tracks of an album sound related</li>
<li>Use a limiter to tame transients</li>
<li>The perceived loudness can be increased using compressors and
limiters</li>
<li>Fades and silence between the songs for the right &lsquo;flow&rsquo;</li>
</ul>
