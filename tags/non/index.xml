      <description>As much as I love the Linux system, its incredible amount of free and open-source software and distributions, and the whole supportive community providing awesome documentation etc., the much pain it was to migrate all my music recording and mixing from Windows to Linux. It cost me numerous sleepless nights and resulted in some quite discouraging failures during my first year of diving into open-source.
The reason I had a hard time back then was not a lack of good documentation or badly implemented software.</description>
