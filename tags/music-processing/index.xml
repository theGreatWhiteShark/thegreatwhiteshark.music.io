      <description>Of course I won&amp;rsquo;t provide conclusive answers to those questions. In truth, this is just my first, humble attempt to grow accustom to my equipment and its peculiarities and frequency responses. But one purpose of this blog is to document my projects and the bottom line of all of this is of course: it&amp;rsquo;s fun to dig into your music and audio signals using your computer. :)
Equipment and software I will use the software presented in my last post on spectral analysis.</description>

      <description>As a disclaimer: I will not write about the Fourier transform and spectra in general. For a very nice and gentle introduction I can recommend the second chapter of Fundamentals of Music Processing by Meinard MÃ¼ller.
Setup As a prerequisite I assume you have the Non DAW Suite installed and JACK configured on your system. Now, power up JACK (e.g. via QjackCtl) and open Non Timeline.
For the sake of reproducibility I will use a gong sample provided by freewavesamples.</description>
