      <description>After we got an overview about the peculiarities of the Linux system with respect to audio and recording in the last post we will dive some more into the Linux sound system itself.
As for most other Linux subsystems the audio one grew quite naturally too. So you have quite a number of alternatives and different ways to achieve a goal. Not just in using different software, but also in the underlying sound servers.</description>

      <description>As much as I love the Linux system, its incredible amount of free and open-source software and distributions, and the whole supportive community providing awesome documentation etc., the much pain it was to migrate all my music recording and mixing from Windows to Linux. It cost me numerous sleepless nights and resulted in some quite discouraging failures during my first year of diving into open-source.
The reason I had a hard time back then was not a lack of good documentation or badly implemented software.</description>
