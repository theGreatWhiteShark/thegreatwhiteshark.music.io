      <description>After we got an overview about the peculiarities of the Linux system with respect to audio and recording in the last post we will dive some more into the Linux sound system itself. If you do not understand every last bit of information in here, don&amp;rsquo;t worry.
The Linux way of handling hardware I don&amp;rsquo;t want to go into too much detail here but instead just hook you up with the general concepts of hardware handling in Linux.</description>

      <description>The reason I had a hard time back then was not a lack of good documentation or badly implemented software. No, quite the opposite. It was the vast amount of different choices I select. Which program to use for recording, which underlying sound server, should I use a real-time kernel or not&amp;hellip; And with every choice I made several new options popped up. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, this is the true power of the Linux system and enables advanced users to surpass everything they possible could accomplish with Windows or Mac.</description>
