      <description>I moved my blog from Wordpress to Github Pages.
In addition, I also decided to split the blog in three different parts. Art, coding, and music are just a little too diverse and I intend to do further posts in all of these subjects.
You can find the blogs via the following links
 music blog coding blog overall blog  Motivation First of all, I have to say: I had a nice time on Wordpress and it was a great place to start my blog.</description>
